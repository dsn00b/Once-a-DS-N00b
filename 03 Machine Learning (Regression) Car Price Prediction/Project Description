In this project, a new car manufacturer wants to enter a market with multiple existing placers and wishes to understand how best to price its cars. It has data covering the price and features of several different cars in the market.

My code (available in the Jupyter notebook shared) identifies relationships between different car features and car price, and ultimately quantifies those relationships via a multivariable regression model
