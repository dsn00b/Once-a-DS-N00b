In this project, I visualise and explore Lending Club loans data to uncover relationships between borrower and loan attributes and the likelihood of the loan to go bad (remain unpaid to the lender).

The Jupyter notebook in this folder has several visualisations and key business insights from this exercise are available in the PDF file

This project was another assignment in the PG Certificate Programme in Machine and Deep Learning with Upgrad / IIIT Bangalore: https://www.upgrad.com/machine-learning-deep-learning-pgc-iiitb/
