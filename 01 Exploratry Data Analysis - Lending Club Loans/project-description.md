- In this project, I visualise and explore Lending Club loans data to uncover relationships between borrower and loan attributes and the likelihood of the loan going bad (remaining unpaid to the lender)
- The files inside include:
  - The data file (loans.csv)
  - A data dictionary file (Data_Dictionary.xlsx)
  - A Jupyter notebook with visualisations and analysis, and
  - A PDF presentation with key insights
