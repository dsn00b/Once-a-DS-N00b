In this project, a telecom services providers wants to predict which of its customers are likely to churn and also understand what factors influence churn, so as to take preventive action. The service provider has data covering the customer behaviour over a four month period.

My code (available in the Jupyter notebook shared) reduces the original dataset into a subset of principle components, takes care of class imbalance (via under-sampling), and runs a variety of different classification algorithms on the transformed dataset (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and Support Vector Machines - Linear, RBF, Polynomial). A separate logistic regression model allows for an explainable factor analysis.
